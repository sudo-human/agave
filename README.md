**agave** is a fixed-width outline typeface family, designed and produced by [type agaric](https://b.agaric.net/about). Started as an educational and experimental endeavor, **agave** remains a hobby project, aiming to bring to development environments and terminals a typographic style that is geometrically regular and simple.

### install

The `.ttf` font files can be found at either of:
- https://github.com/blobject/agave/releases/latest
- https://github.com/blobject/agave/tree/master/dist

Please install according to common procedures specified by your platform. Maybe these pages might help: [repology](https://repology.org/project/fonts:agave/versions), [howtogeek](https://www.howtogeek.com/192980/how-to-install-remove-and-manage-fonts-on-windows-mac-and-linux).


### build

For example, with the Regular variant:

- Open `src/agave-r.sfd` in FontForge.
- Click **File** --> **Generate Fonts** --> pick **TrueType**, **No Bitmap Fonts**, **No Rename** --> *Options:* pick **TrueType Hints**, **PS Glyph Names**, **OpenType** --> confirm --> **Generate**.
  - You might see (and can ignore, I think) some warnings about non-integral coordinates, etc.
- Hint the generated font file using ttfautohint.
  - Assuming the generated file is `raw.ttf`, run `ttfautohint -v -t raw.ttf Agave-Regular.ttf`

### naming

- **agave** is sister to [autonoe](https://github.com/blobject/autonoe) and [ino](https://github.com/blobject/ino).
